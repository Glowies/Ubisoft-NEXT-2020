# Ubisoft NEXT 2020 Programming Challenge
My submission for the Ubiosft NEXT 2020 Programming Challenge.

## Code Directory
All the code written by me can be found under the directory [GameTest/glowEngine](GameTest/glowEngine)

## Documentation
The Doxygen generated documentation for my part of the code: [glowEngine_docs.pdf](glowEngine_docs.pdf)

## Design Influences
The the majority of my design was based on the GameObject-Component relationship seen in the Unity Game Engine.
Similar to how Components are attached to GameObjects in a Unity Scene, in my engine Attachments are attached to Entities, which are then placed in a Level.
